Plant Guard
===========

This project helps you monitoring, watering and keeping care of your (indoor) plants.

What you need
-------------

  * An Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller Board (code is written in Arduino IDE, but we plan to port it to C)
  * A WiFly shield for the arduino
  * A twitter account and a wifi in range of you plant
  * An LM35 temperature sensor
  * An LM358 Op-Amp
  * 1x 220 Ohm resistor
  * 1x 10k Ohm resistor
  * 3x 100k Ohm resistors
  * A humidity sensor, built from two plug connector pins soldered to wire (spacing is important: use standard plug connector pins for this!)
  * A 12V elecronically open- and closeable valve
  * A plastic bottle with bottom cut off and some stand to safely put it upside down
  * some water tube to connect bottle, valve and plant
  * a willing (and maybe robust) plant :)
